# TransientVisualizer
The TransientVisualizer was designed to extract calcium transients and sarcomere shortening data from microscope line-scan images.

The PyQt5 library is used by this software. The software opens microscope images in OME-TIFF format containing fluorescence and transmission channels. 
The software can export files with time cources in .xlsx and .csv formats (it can be chosen by user) for calcium transients and sarcomere shortening separately.
